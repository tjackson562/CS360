The app is a weight tracker designed to address the user's need to track and monitor their weight over time.

The necessary screens and features include a login/register screen, a main dashboard screen displaying weight tracking data, and a form for adding new weight data. The UI designs kept users in mind by being simple, intuitive, and visually appealing. The designs were successful because they were easy to use and provided clear feedback to the user.

The process of coding the app involved using Java and the Android Studio IDE. The techniques and strategies used included writing clean, modular code, using design patterns, and testing the app throughout the development process. These strategies could be applied in future projects to improve code quality and maintainability.

Testing was done through manual testing and unit testing to ensure the app was functional and free of bugs. This process is important to ensure the app works as expected and to catch any issues before releasing the app to users.
